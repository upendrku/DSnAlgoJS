## Heap's Algorithm - Generate Permutations

Heap's algorithm generates all possible permutations of n objects. It was first proposed by B. R. Heap in 1963. The algorithm minimizes movement: it generates each permutation from the previous one by interchanging a single pair of elements; the other nâˆ’2 elements are not disturbed.

# Number of Permutations

Total number of permutations = n! where n is the number of items.
