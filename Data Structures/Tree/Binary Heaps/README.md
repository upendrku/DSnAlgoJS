## WHAT IS A BINARY HEAP?
Very similar to a binary search tree, but with some different rules!
In a MaxBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always larger than child nodes. 
In a MinBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always smaller than child nodes

## MAX BINARY HEAP
Each parent has at most two child nodes
The value of each parent node is always greater than its child nodes
In a max Binary Heap the parent is greater than the children, but there are no guarantees between sibling nodes.
A binary heap is as compact as possible. All the children of each node are as full as they can be and left children are filled out first

## Why do we need to know this?
Binary Heaps are used to implement Priority Queues, which are very commonly used data structures
They are also used quite a bit, with graph traversal algorithms

## THERE'S AN EASY WAY OF STORING A BINARY HEAP...
A LIST/ARRAY

## INSERT PSEUDOCODE
<code>
Push the value into the values property on the heap
Bubble Up:
    Create a variable called index which is the length of the values property - 1
    Create a variable called parentIndex which is the floor of (index-1)/2
    Keep looping as long as the values element at the parentIndex is less than the values element at the child index
        Swap the value of the values element at the parentIndex with the value of the element property at the child index
        Set the index to be the parentIndex, and start over!
</code>

## REMOVING FROM A HEAP
Remove the root
Replace with the most recently added
Adjust (sink down)

## SINK DOWN
The procedure for deleting the root from the heap (effectively extracting the maximum element in a max-heap or the minimum element in a min-heap) and restoring the properties is called down-heap (also known as bubble-down, percolate-down, sift-down, trickle down, heapify-down, cascade-down, and extract-min/max).

## REMOVING (also called extractMax)
<code>
Swap the first value in the values property with the last one
Pop from the values property, so you can return the value at the end.
Have the new root "sink down" to the correct spot...â€‹
    Your parent index starts at 0 (the root)
    Find the index of the left child: 2 * index + 1 (make sure its not out of bounds)
    Find the index of the right child: 2*index + 2 (make sure its not out of bounds)
    If the left or right child is greater than the element...swap. If both left and right children are larger, swap with the largest child.
    The child index you swapped to now becomes the new parent index.  
    Keep looping and swapping until neither child is larger than the element.
    Return the old root!
</code>

## Big O of Binary Heaps
Insertion -   O(log N)
Removal -   O(log N)
Search -   O(N)

## RECAP
Binary Heaps are very useful data structures for sorting, and implementing other data structures like priority queues
Binary Heaps are either MaxBinaryHeaps or MinBinaryHeaps with parents either being smaller or larger than their children
With just a little bit of math, we can represent heaps using arrays!
